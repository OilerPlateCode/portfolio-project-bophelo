# portfolio-project-bophelo
Spring boot portfolio project to track my commitment to fitness

## About this project
The purpose of this project is for me to learn and show my competence with Spring boot.
To learn, I will follow along on this [Springboot Crash course on YouTube from FreeCodeCamp's channel] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31KTdfRH6nY&pp=ygUYZnJlZWNvZGVjYW1wIHNwcmluZyBib290)
This course builds an app to track a user's Runners.
As a person who enjoys fitness, I plan to expand on this course and make this project my own, using it daily.

### Exercises
- CRUD a Cycle using an Array - Benefit exposes me to working with Arrays in Java god prep for the exam
- Add the Exception handlers on my own.
- Fix the folder structure after completing the tutorial video (which is just over 3.5 hours)
- Do some more manual validation

### Making the project my own
Simply coding along on the course and having the exact same code as the course will not prove my proficiency in Java and Spring boot.
To demonstrate my competence, I will need to make the code my own by implementing extra features and using industry standard folder structures.
As this is a learning project there will be no consistency in how someone the solutions are solved. 
The reason being, there are many ways to solve the same problem. To adapt to different codebases I will need to explore the different popular ways teams different use to solve
**For example I will not always use the repository pattern I will also use Entity Manager.

### Rest client section of the course
The second last module of the course introduced using rest clint by calling the placeholder api
I decided to use REST client to add automated REST test my API rather. Instead of calling json placeholder I call my API and test my endpoints.

### TODO
- Improve the folder structure, following enterprise standards
- Add feature to track my Cycling
- Add feature to track my swimming
- Add feature to track my workouts
- Connect to a Front End (iOS/Android/Web)
- Deploy the app
- Add automated Integration Tests
- Use additional libraries
- Explore Springboot docs and implement features to learn.
- Add Manual Mapping
- Map using a Library (MapStruct)

### Competencies shown
- Use of Git Branching and Pull Requests: 
  - `learn`: Commits prefixed with `learn` are for commits from the commits from the course.
  - `feature`: These commits are my commits independent form the course implementing my own problem-solving
  - `docs`: These commit represent documentation 
- Docker using docker for my deploy and for the Database

### Archetectural Decisions
I need to make decision on how to model the tables and their relationships
